v1.19
When defining a parent category, a column can be dragged across to define the parent in which case one parent will be created for each unique string in the indicated column of the CSV, and it will be a parent to only those topics which have
the same string in that particular CSV column.

v1.18
Allow a True Name and some "Other Names" to be entered from CSV columns.

v1.17
When reading an image from a network URL, attempt to handle HTTP redirect requests properly.

v1.16
Allow a URL to be used as an alternative to a local file for the external object loading introduced in v1.11
Disable GENERATE button while the export is being generated.

v1.14
Detect URLs in the middle of blocks of text being imported and encode them so that they appear as links inside RealmWorks.

v1.12
Fix a small bug in the CSV reader so that a " at the end of a line is handled properly.

v1.11
Need to load HeroLab portfolio files for all your favourite NPCs?
Extend the file loading to include the following snippet types: Portfolio, Statblock, Rich_Text, PDF, Audio, Video, HTML, Foreign.

v1.10
Picture and Smart Images can have their picture loaded based on the filename being in a cell of the CSV.
The named file is loaded during the GENERATE process.

v1.9
When importing CSV files, line breaks inside quoted cell values are now supported.
Blank lines in quoted blocks are treated as paragraph breaks for Label_Text and Multi_Line fields.

v1.8
This release fixes an issue where the RWEXPORT file would contain one or more blank topics if the original Realm Works structure file contains a category defined as a child of another category. (E.g. Location in the basic Pathfinder category structure).

v1.7
Small update that ignores blank lines in the CSV file so that a valid XML file is always generated.

v1.6
Ensure "Realm Works" is displayed with the registered trademark symbol in all places.
Improve the tool-tips.
Remember the last used directory for each of the file selector dialogs.
Allow multi-line text in snippets which are supposed to allow multiple lines.

v1.5
This release allows you to type in some free text into a snippet, or choose a tag for a choice field, instead of having CSV data appear in the field.
You can't mix CSV data and free text in the same snippet (yet) though.
It also fixes a bug where sometimes a partition in the structure part of the XML file would wrongly get text attached to it.

v1.4
The entire topic, as well as the optional containing topic, can now be marked as REVEALED to players (using the circular button to the left of topic name).
This updates the existing functionality where individual snippets could be marked as revealed.

v1.3.1
A minor update to add validation to the new optional parent. You must enter a name, and you must choose a different category for the parent to the one chosen for the CSV data.

v1.3
Provide the option to have all imported topics/articles placed under a single parent category.

v1.2
The installer now adds the application to the Start Menu.
Fixed a bug with the layout of elements when there was a blank snippet in the template.

v1.1
Name of the topic/article is now mandatory.
In tag snippets, the annotation is correctly placed before the tag_assign.
Installer files are now part of the software sources on github.
Empty cells in the CSV now don't provide the corresponding snippet (previously it put an empty string into the snippet).
Prevent crash if the CSV had less entries in a data row than was in the header row.
Remove the "gm_only" button since it isn't the way that Realm WorksÂ® does thing.

v1.0.0
The top drop-down menu does nothing.
